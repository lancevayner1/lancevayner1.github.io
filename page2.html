    <b>Day 2</b>
<br>
<br>
  For day 2 of the tour, we will first stop at Green Dragon Inn (Chapter 2). Here is where Bilbo, Thorin and the rest of the dwarves meet up, and wait to begin their journey. Just like everyone met up here, we will meet up here to have lunch! We have to fill up on food before we go to Rivendell. Rivendell is a very important stop in our journey. This is where the heroes of the hobbit “cross the threshold / enter the unknown.”
 <br><br>
We have arrived at Rivendell! Here we can get information on what's to come in the Misty Mountains from Elrond, the leader of the elves. Meeting Elrond and the elves represents the “supernatural allies” part of our journey. Elrond will lead the tour of Rivendell. Here, the group will be able to pose and take pictures with replicas of Gandalf’s and Thorin’s swords.
<br><br>
<b>Day 3</b>
<br><br>
After a restful night of sleeping in a troll cave, we will depart for the Misty Mountains. But first, we will stop at Gollum’s cave, one of the “tests/roads of trials.” To replicate the experience of Bilbo in Gollum’s cave, participants will be able to play a virtual reality video game where they have to grab the ring of invisibility and escape Gollum.
<br><br>
After Gollum’s cave, we will stop at the Misty Mountains and climb a mountain. Mountain climbing equipment and anti-fog glasses will be provided. Once on top of the Misty Mountains, we will discuss how Bilbo and the dwarves escaped the Wargs and goblins here:
<br><br>
We will transport via eagle out of the Misty Mountains, just like Bilbo and company were flown out of the Misty Mountains by the Lord of the Eagles, a supernatural ally. We will be transported to the house of Beorn, another supernatural ally who gave advice, food, and lodging to the group, where we will be spending the third night. The “wooden house” with “two long wings'' (Chapter 7) is surrounded by great oak trees. Beorn has rented out his home for the tour so it is the original home where Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves stayed!
<br><br>
<b>Day 4</b>
<br><br>
In the Misty Mountains we will be embarking on a gloomy and dangerous journey. In this part of our tour we will be learning about “roads of trials.” This is where Bilbo and the company fight the spiders and elves. On their way through the mountains to the Lonely Mountain their path is very dark. They saw a light and disregarded Beorn’s advice not to stray off the path. They followed this light. While being near the light, the light shuts off. After a long time of traveling Bilbo gets tired and falls asleep on a tree. Bilbo wakes up and he sees he is tied up by the silk of giant spiders. He uses his blade, and cuts the silk to free himself and slays the spider. Bilbo decides to name his blade Sting. After slaying the spider, Bilbo sees the company tied up by more spiders. He throws rocks at the spiders and makes noises, while wearing his magic ring so they flee. Bilbo frees the company. This is an essential part to “allies, enemies, and tests” because he helps his allies by freeing them. After a short time, the spiders return. Everyone is injured due to the spider's poison, and Bilbo can’t fight the spiders on his own. When all odds are turned against them, the spiders choose not to attack but retreat.
<br><br>
	Shortly after escaping from the spiders the company realizes that Thorin is missing. Here, dramatic irony takes place. We know that Thorin is captured by the elves, however the company doesn't know this yet. The elves were suspicious of Thorin, so they took him captive. The elves questioned Thorin but Thorin did not want to tell the elves about his journey. Therefore the elves threw him in a dungeon. Later the rest of the dwarves are captured by elves and taken captive. However Bilbo was undetected due to his ring. The dwarves are thrown in the dungeon like Thorin and held captive. Bilbo plots an escape plan to free the dwarves, while being unseen because of his ring. Bilbo frees the dwarves by secretly taking the key from the guardsman. He packs the dwarves into barrels and sends them down the river into Lake-Town. Now the company has escaped the Misty Mountains.
<br><br>
	On day 4 you can stay at a camp sight similarly to how Bilbo and the dwarves were stuck in a stray path. You can play a high-tech video game where you can slay your own spiders with a blade like Bilbo. You can also take a waterslide in a barrel shaped raft to portray how the company escaped! This is all included in our special tour!
